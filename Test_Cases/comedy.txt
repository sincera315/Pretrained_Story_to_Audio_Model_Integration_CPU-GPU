Lenny decided to surprise everyone with his cooking skills. He picked a pasta recipe but misread nearly every instruction. Instead of teaspoons, he added tablespoons. He boiled the noodles for an hour, thinking, “Extra soft is good, right?” Then he added peanut butter because he’d run out of tomato sauce. When dinner was served, even the dog looked alarmed. The fire alarm beeped in agreement. Lenny's culinary career ended that night.
