Detective Mora examined the scene carefully. Under the shattered lamp was a note: “Midnight. The bridge.” No signature, no traces—only a faint perfume scent. Fog cloaked the city as the clock struck twelve. Mora waited. A figure emerged from the shadows, silent, watching. She approached, but before she could speak, it vanished. In its place lay a single white glove. The mystery deepened—this was only the beginning of something bigger.
